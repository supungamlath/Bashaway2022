# Mini-Studio

## Scenario

Ryder is a newbie YouTuber who runs a mini studio in Groove Street, Los Santos. He creates lyrics videos for the latest music tracks and publishes them on YouTube. He also monetizes them to earn money from YouTube. These videos are pretty simple as the lyrics are displayed in real-time in front of a static image.

 In the early days, Ryder used Windows Movie Maker to create the lyrics videos. Still, it takes him a few hours to correctly match the lyrics and the music to create the music video. Therefore he invites his neighbor Carl Johnson (CJ). He is a multi-talented guy, and this mission is about finding a way to make Ryder's job easier so he can make more money quickly.

## Task

Assume you are CJ, skilled in Python automation. To pass this mission, you must develop a python script to automate the lyric video generation process by providing the background image, music track (mp3 file), lyrics and timeline. The script should generate a lyric video with that provided data where the output should be in mp4 format.

Refer to the given dataset for further understanding.
