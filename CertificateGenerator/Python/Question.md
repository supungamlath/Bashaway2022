# Certificate Generator

## Scenario

Moordale High School is organizing its annual prize-giving ceremony. The organizing committee has planned to distribute certificates to more than 400 students resulting in 400 certificates awarded. So manually completing all these certificates is a tedious task. So school management decided to get help from Otis Milburn, who is good at automation, to get this automated.

## Task

Assume you are Otis and develop a script to generate the certificates using the following assets automatically.
1. Certificate Template (certificate.png)
2. Signature (signature.png)
3. Student Name (candidates.csv)
4. Font (basic-font.ttf)

Font should be in Black: RGB(0,0,0) in size 16. For each student in the name list, a separate PDF file should be a seperate PDF file generated in the output folder.
