They have already bought the plastic clip but they have only a few hours left to get done the stickers. 

Stickers should be rounded printed on A4 size sticker papers. Each A4 sheet can hold up to 8 stickers as 4 rows with 2 columns in each in portrait orientation. Stickers should contain the images provided in the "images" folder. Once the 8 images are placed correctly in the layout, the finalized layout should be exported as a single PDF file.
