# Event Rush

## Scenario 

Clay Jensen and Hannah Baker organize a suicide prevention awareness event at Liberty High School, Evergreen County, California. As a part of the event, they plan to make photo badges that can be stuck on the shoulder as fancy items. They will be pasting a rounded sticker on a round plastic plate with a clip to make the photo badges. They have already bought the plastic clip but only a few hours left to get the stickers done. 

Stickers should be rounded and printed on A4 size sticker paper. Each A4 sheet can hold up to 8 stickers as 4 rows with 2 columns in each in portrait orientation. Stickers should contain the images provided in the "images" folder. Once the 8 images are placed correctly in the layout, the finalized layout should be exported as a single PDF file.

To get the job run in the run, they invite Tyler, who is familiar with tech. 

## Task

Assume you are Tyler and develop a Java program to generate the PDF with all the provided images in the images directory. The PDF should contain all the given square shaped images in rounded shape at 8 stickers per 1 sheet. The 8 stickers should be placed on a portrait-oriented sheet as 4 rows with 2 columns.

For further understanding of the layout, refer to the following image.
