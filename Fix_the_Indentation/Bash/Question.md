# Fix the Indentation

## Scenario

Jessie is a newbie to Linux. However, he has learned some Bash scripting by following tutorials on the internet and trial and error. As we all know, Bash is not indentation sensitive. Jessie also ignores the indentations in his Bash scripts.

Suddenly, Jessie realized that his scripts were challenging to read because he had not followed the programming best practice of indenting. Now he is struggling to rearrange all his Bash scripts according to the correct indentations. To get this sorted out, Jessie seeks his teachers' help, who's Mr. White.

## Task

Assume you are Mr. White. Your task is to develop a Bash script to fix all the selection (if/else) and repetition (loops) related to indentation issues in Jessie's Bash scripts. Also, use a single blank line above and below every loop so that Jessie can refer to his codes easier, and he can continue his self-learning.

Jessie's original scripts are stored in a folder by his name. You should save indentation fixed bash scripts into a folder by the name "White." Newly created files should have the same name as their original counterparts.
